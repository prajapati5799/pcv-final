&#9989;&nbsp;**watch_view**: values: 'posts',  'terms', 'none'. What to show on the end of the chain. Posts - drop-down with posts. Terms - button with the link to posts of the selected term in the last drop-down. None - nothing, good to apply with products tables filtering.

&#9989;&nbsp;**label_taxonomy**:  label(s) of the drop-down(s). Example: 'Producer'.

    $res = 'Producer';
    //for WPML compatibility as an example
    if (defined('ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE')) {
        switch (ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE) {
            case 'es':
                $res = 'Productor';
                break;
            case 'uk':
                $res = 'Виробник';
                break;
        }
    }
 
    return $res;
}, 10, 1);
`

&#9989;&nbsp;**label_post**: label of the posts drop-down. To use action instead of text in file functions.php add next code: (<em>must started from 'call_filter_'</em>)
`
add_filter('chain1-post', function($args) {
 
    $res = 'Select car';
    //for WPML compatibility as an example
    if (defined('ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE')) {
        switch (ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE) {
            case 'es':
                $res = 'Seleccionar coche';
                break;
            case 'uk':
                $res = 'Яке твое авто';
                break;
            default:
                $res = 'Select your car';
                break;

        switch (ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE) {
            case 'es':
                $res = 'Tomar lo!';
                break;
            case 'uk':
                $res = 'Забираймо!';
